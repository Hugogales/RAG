    "This article explains the Progress Touch Base check\\-in and provides best practices to prepare for a productive conversation between Partners and their leaders on progress toward performance, development and career goals.\n\n\n \n\n\n[Progress Touch Base Approach](#h_01J44JT8TDT7QWH3JQ3XY4E6YF)\n\n\n[Preparing for your Your Progress Touch Base](#h_01J44K2NFZA93VK8Z03MKNW5T6)\n\n\n[Completing Your Progress Touch Base](#h_01J44JTQYYXEAQRJ1BFBHN50VW)\n\n\n[Launching Your Own Progress Touch Base](#h_01J44K0KQH157SNN5492PV9SCP)\n\n\n[Leaders: Viewing your Team's Progress Touch Base Status](#h_01J44KS27Y34J987ER9CG87FA9)\n\n\n#### \n\n\n#### **Progress Touch Base Approach**\n\n\nThe **Progress Touch Base** is a brief question\\-based framework to formally check in on progress toward Performance Goals, Bonus Goals (if applicable), and Development Goals. Partners and Leaders answer the questions individually and then have a conversation about overall progress and make necessary updates to their goals. Leaders will also assign Partners with a trending rating toward their Performance Goals. The Progress Touch Base is launched company\\-wide by HR in Q3\\. Partners can also launch a Progress Touch Base on their own at any time. \n\n\n#### \n\n\n#### **Preparing for your Your Progress Touch Base**\n\n\nPartners should have recurring conversations with their leaders throughout the year on their performance, development and career goals. The progress touch base process, which is launched in Workday, provides a formal opportunity for Partners and their leaders to check in on progress and discuss what is needed to end the year strong. To prepare for your progress touch base conversation with your leader:\n\n\n1. **Honestly reflect on your results and the progress you made toward your** [performance goals](https://7400support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/22070592084749-Performance-Goals)**.** Think about what went well, what could have gone better, and if your performance goals have or should change from when you set them during the goal\\-setting process earlier in the year.\n2. With your performance goals in mind, **review your** [development goals](https://7400support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/22070614614541-Development-Goals)**.** Consider your **strengths and development opportunities** to focus on now and in the future. Also think about your career aspirations and how you can do more of your best work and operate at the top of your license. Review the [DS 2\\.0 skills](https://7400support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15685029528205-DS-2-0-Skills) and identify updates to your current development goals or create new goals you want to focus on. In addition to DS 2\\.0 skills, think about the additional professional or tech skills you want to build now and in the future.\n\n\n#### **Completing Your Progress Touch Base**\n\n\nSet aside time to thoughtfully complete your Progress Touch Base. \n\n\n1. Access the To\\-Do in your Outlook inbox day To\\-Do. Considering your prep work, click \"Get Started\" to answer questions about your performance, development and career goals. Your leader, and matrix leader, if applicable, will review your answers and provide their own perspective to prepare for a live conversation.\n\n\n***Add screen shot of questions***\n\n\n1. You can review your performance goals by clicking on X\n\n\n***Add screen shot of embedded report***\n\n\n1. Review your development goals to update progress or add new goals.\n\n\n***Add screen shot of dev goals***\n\n\n \n\n\n**Additional Information Section**: Define the behavior change or skill you will build to drive your performance and achieve your career goals.\n\n\n**Status Notes Section:** Enter and track the action items you’ll complete (e.g., on the job experiences, mentoring, networking, resources and formal learning opportunities).\n\n\n1. Submit your progress touch base to your leader, who will be notified that you are complete. Make notes of key areas that you want to discuss in your Progress Touch Base conversation with your leader, including your progress on performance goals, your strengths and development areas, and your career interests.\n\n\n***Add screen shot of submitting PTB***\n\n\n \n\n\n#### **Launching Your Own Progress Touch Base**\n\n\nIt’s recommended that Partners and leaders have recurring conversations about their performance, development and career goals. To support these conversations, Partners can also launch a progress touch base at any time through the ‘Start My Performance Review’ option within the Performance Tab in Workday.\n\n\n \n\n\n***Add screen shot.***\n\n\n \n\n\n#### **Leaders: Viewing your Team's Progress Touch Base Status**\n\n\n \n\n",

Time blocks are displayed and can be edited by clicking on them. All the other time functions like **Send Back**, **Submit**, and **Approve** are all available on this one screen for your entire team.\n\n\n \n\n\n### Review Time\n\n\n**Review Time** is a similar report but arranged differently.

    "Workday allows you to temporarily delegate your involvement to start or approve a business process and/or inbox items to another Partner. Delegation is used when you are unable to perform the actions yourself, typically due to extended time off. While delegation is a convenient option to gain assistance with leadership responsibilities, the accountability for the task and approval remains with the delegator.\n\n\nConsiderations\n--------------\n\n\n* **Temporary Delegation:** Use to temporarily delegate your role to another Partner, typically when on vacation, leave, etc.\n* **No Restrictions**: You can delegate to any Partner. Ensure it is appropriate for the Partner to have access to sensitive data.\n* **No Approvals Required:** Setting up a delegation does not require approvals.\n* **Empowerment**: The act of delegation empowers the delegate to take the assigned action (to review, approve, etc.) on behalf of the leader.\n* **Multiple Delegates**: You can assign a business process to more than one delegate.\n* **Responsibility**: Delegation temporarily reassigns tasks/approvals to a delegate but does not remove responsibility from the delegator. When the delegation period ends, any incomplete delegated tasks revert to the delegator.\n\n\nAccessing Delegated Tasks\n-------------------------\n\n\n* To access tasks that were delegated to you, click your photo (top right) and then click the **Switch Account** link.\n\n\nSetting up Delegations\n----------------------\n\n\n### Using a Desktop\n\n\n![My Delegations.png](https://7400support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/28841669201805)![Manage Delegations.png](https://7400support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/28841669203597)\n\n\n**Manage Delegations**\n\n\n1.

    "How to Manage Payment Elections in Workday\n==========================================\n\n\nManaging your payment elections in Workday is a straightforward process, but it requires a few specific steps. Here’s a step\\-by\\-step guide to help you navigate through it.\n\n\n**Step 1: Accessing Payment Elections**\n\n\n1. **Open Workday**: Start by logging into your Workday account.\n2. **Search for 'Payment Elections'**: Use the search bar at the top of the page to look for 'Payment Elections'. Select it from the search results. This will display your current bank account information on file.\n\n\n**Step 2: Adding a New Bank Account**  \nAdding a new bank account involves two main steps: adding the account itself and then adjusting your payment elections accordingly.\n\n\n1. **Add a Bank Account:**\n\t* Click on the 'Add' button to add another bank account.\n\t* Enter your new bank account information and submit it.\n\t* Make sure to delete any closed, inactive accounts.  \n\t![Add Bank Account.png](https://7400support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/28657876875405)\n2. **Adjust Payment Elections:**\n\t* + In the \"Payment Elections\" section, you will see two Pay Types: Bi\\-Weekly and Annual. Click on 'Edit' for the type you wish to update.\n\t\t\t- **Bi\\-Weekly Pay** defines the treatment for anything paid out on our standard, bi\\-weekly pay period schedule.\n\t\t\t- **Annual Pay** defines the treatment for profit sharing and annual bonuses. Setting up payment elections for Annual Pay is not required—this payment will default to the elections set up for Bi\\-Weekly Pay type unless you designate otherwise.\n\t\t+ You can add up to a maximum of 8 payment elections per Pay Type.\n\t\t+ Click on the ‘plus’ sign to add a new account, or the ‘minus’ sign to delete one.\n\t\t+ When adding/editing an election, **Payment Type should be 'direct deposit'**.\n\t\t+ Select or update the bank account. An account must be added (see above) to be made available here.\n\t\t+ Specify if you want the entire balance, a specific amount, or a percentage of your payment to go into the bank account selected for this line.\n\t\t+ Always define the exceptions first, as the last election specified must be designated as your Balance account.\n\t\t\t- Example: If you want $50 or 5% of your pay to go to a savings account, enter this line first. The second line would be designated as “Balance” in either case. You would not enter 5% and then 95% if using percentages.\n\t\t+ Click 'OK' to save your changes.\n\n\nImportant Notes:\n================\n\n\n1. **Effective Date of Changes:** To ensure changes take effect by the next pay date, they must be entered into Workday by the last Friday of the [pay period](https://7400support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/11491916831501). For example, to make changes for a check paid on Friday the 14th, ensure they are entered by Friday the 7th.\n2. **Designating a Balance Account:** Partners must designate one account as the “Balance” account when setting up their bi\\-weekly payment elections. This is true if you are defining your elections in dollars or percentages.\n3. **Expense Reports:** The account designated to receive the Balance of your bi\\-weekly payroll payments will also be used by Accounts Payable for expense report payments. Not designating a Balance account may result in incorrect expense report payments.\n\n\nFollowing these steps will help you efficiently manage your payment elections in Workday, ensuring that your payments are directed exactly where you need them.\n\n\n \n\n\nFor additional assistance, [email the Payroll team](mailto:resourcepayroll@directs.com). \n\n",

    "Introduction:\n=============\n\n\nHow to Use this Guide\n---------------------\n\n\n###### **Doing the Right Thing**\n\n\nIt is every Champion Partner’s duty to act with honesty, integrity, professionalism and respect, and to comply with all laws and regulations. “Doing the right thing” is what working at Direct Supply is all about. In the words of our President and CEO:\n\n\n*Much has changed about our company . . . but some things haven’t – our commitment to our people, to outrageous customer service, to doing the right thing. We believe deeply in those principles. Direct Supply is committed to many of the old\\-fashioned values that made our country great. We have a plan for the future and a faith that we will do well over the long pull because of our beliefs and commitments. It’s all up to our people . . .*\n\n\n\\- Robert J. Hillis, CEO\n\n\n**How to Use the*****Champion Partner Guide***\n\n\nIt is Direct Supply’s expectation that all Champion Partners will adhere to Direct Supply policies and comply with all applicable laws related to our business. This guide provides you with an overview of our compliance program, key guidelines and best practices, and copies of our compliance\\-related policies for your reference. Please review your *Champion Partner Guide*as follows:\n\n\n+ Read the one\\-page “Overview” insert that gives you a summary of some of the key components of our compliance program.\n+ Read the message from Bob Hillis, our President \\& CEO, to learn more about the importance of our compliance program to Direct Supply.\n+ Read the Compliance Guidelines \\& Best Practices and note the additional resources that are available.\n+ Review each policy that relates to your job and approach your leader with any questions you may have about how our policies apply to your position\n+ Acknowledge the *Commitment to* *Integrity in Action*within Workday, indicating your understanding and acknowledgement of your responsibilities under Direct Supply’s compliance program.\n\n\nPlease remember that a Champion Partner’s disregard for Direct Supply policies or the law could have serious consequences both for the Champion Partner and Direct Supply. Such consequences could include criminal or civil prosecution, lawsuits and damage to each of our good names. Champion Partners who violate Direct Supply policies or the law, fail to report violations, or unlawfully retaliate against Partners for reporting such violations may be subject to disciplinary action, up to termination of employment.\n\n\nMessage from Direct Supply's CEO, Bob Hillis\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Dear Partners,**\n\n\nWhile Direct Supply continues to grow, some things will never change – especially our commitment to doing the right thing. This commitment runs throughout our Principles and is critical to every person who relies on Direct Supply: our customers, residents, our business partners, and ultimately every Champion Partner and our families.\n\n\nOur compliance program, called *Integrity in Action*, and this *Champion Partner Guide*are nothing new to Direct Supply – we’ve always been committed to acting with integrity and complying with the law. However, we wanted to give each Champion Partner additional resources, tools, and practical guidance for identifying legal and integrity issues. Our compliance program also reaffirms every Champion Partner’s duty to speak up and act when they see a potential legal or integrity problem, without fear of retaliation.\n\n\nTogether with the other members of our Board of Directors, I fully support Direct Supply’s compliance program. The consolidation of our policies, implementation of our Integrity Helpline, and the oversight of our Audit Committee will assist us in making sure that we meet our ongoing compliance requirements and continue our commitment to quality, excellence and integrity in everything we do.\n\n\nI challenge each of our great Champion Partners to champion this cause, to do the right thing and to speak up if you ever have any concerns that we’re not meeting our legal or ethical obligations. Our reputation and the success of our business are all about YOU – the employee owners of Direct Supply. And I know that each of us will continue to do what’s necessary and right to ensure that Direct Supply continues to be one of the most respected businesses in America.\n\n\n![Bob_Hillis_Signature.png](https://7400support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/27455582780045)\n\n\nBob Hillis CEO\n\n\nDirect Supply, Inc.\n\n\nCompliance Overview\n-------------------\n\n\n###### **Integrity in Action Generally**\n\n\nDirect Supply’s compliance program, called *Integrity in Action*, helps us educate and train our Champion Partners on important legal and ethical requirements integral to our business to ensure that we are acting consistent with the law, promoting a safe and productive workplace, and making smart, principled business decisions.
